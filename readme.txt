Hi, Dr. Wilkerson!

After reviewing the "Chartability Workbook" (https://chartability.github.io/POUR-CAF), I think that I need to improve keyboard probing functionality for my final project (https://kiron-ang.github.io/lonestarimmunity). It is possible to generate a chart using just the keyboard, but it is difficult to see what button is currently in focus. Furthermore, once a chart is generated, it is impossible to access any of the mouseover tooltips that I worked so hard to develop. I understand now why this workbook recommends to always test for accessibility as you work, because it definitely would have been helpful to test this earlier to find a better solution. Thank you for introducing me to this resource.

Also, here is my example alternative text for assignment 9: Figure 1 is a vertical bar chart that measures the MMR vaccination coverage among seventh graders in the 2023-2024 school year, where each bar represents the coverage for a school district in Travis county. The bars are ordered from greatest coverage to least, showing that some school districts have low vaccination coverage.

Sincerely,

Kiron Ang
