Hi, Dr. Wilkerson!

After reviewing the "Chartability Workbook" (https://chartability.github.io/POUR-CAF), I think that I n need to improve keyboard probing functionality for my final project (https://kiron-ang.github.io/lonestarimmunity). It is possible to generate a chart using just the keyboard, but it is difficult to see what button is currently in focus. Furthermore, once a chart is generated, it is impossible to access any of the mouseover tooltips that I worked so hard to develop. I understand now why this workbook recommends to always test for accessibility as you work, because it definitely would have been helpful to test this earlier to find a better solution. Thank you for introducing me to this resource.

Sincerely,

Kiron Ang
